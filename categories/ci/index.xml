&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Versioning: sometimes dependencies can require specific versions of other dependencies and this can cause hiccups in your app;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bundling: you need to be careful here to not bring extra code that will bloat your bundles;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updating: JavaScript moves fast and if you don&amp;rsquo;t update packages regularly, you&amp;rsquo;ll play Jenga in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are different tools to cover the update part like &lt;a href="https://dependencies.io">Dependencies.io&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot&lt;/a>. Since I have been using Dependabot for a while, I decided to write about my experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dependabot is a tool acquired by GitHub one year ago that checks dependencies files from different languages (Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, to name a few) and finds new versions of libraries you are using in your project. Here is the setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://leonardofaria.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dependabot.jpg" alt="Dependabot screenshot">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daily updates can be overwhelming and I think that weekly updates have a better cost/benefit. Also, I assign myself the Pull Requests so I can get notifications as soon they are opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-dependabot-effectively">How to use Dependabot effectively&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dependabot includes in each PR release notes, changelogs, commits links and vulnerability details whenever available. This is useful because you can take a look at the information and decide to proceed or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as pragmatic programmers, we want to ensure things won&amp;rsquo;t break. The PR details are important but more than that, we want a simulation of all (or almost all) deliverables that the project has.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://leonardofaria.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/semaphore.jpg" alt="CI Integration">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This screenshot shows what happens every time a PR is opened in the components library codebase of my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tests (Jest / Bundle)&lt;/strong>: the Jest task will test the React components while the Bundle task will simulate the bundling commands we run when we want to update the package in the NPM registry;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Linters (Stylesheets / JavaScript)&lt;/strong>: the stylesheet files follow a custom sass-lint setup and the JS code follows a series of ESLint rules. If a PR introduces a new version of a linter with new rules we will be able to capture that;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cypress (Screenshot Testing / Accessibility Testing)&lt;/strong>: if a new package introduces changes that may reflect in the look and feel of components, Cypress will capture the difference, screenshot it and store in S3. Since Cypress needs a live version of the documentation website, we also get the Gatsby build process covered.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With all these steps, it is very unlikely an external package will break our master branch. Kudos to my co-worker Grant Lee that also works in this project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
