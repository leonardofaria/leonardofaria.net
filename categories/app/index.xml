This is one of most popular tests to prove English skills. It is considered by many people a tough exam because it requires not only English skills, but also time management skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The test takes 4 hours to be finished. The last part of the test is to write 2 texts in 50 minutes. In the first task, the student is supposed to summarise a text and a lecture, which lecture sometimes cast doubt in the passage. The second one is called independent task. In this task the student should write about a specific subject. During my preparation, I written more than 50 texts and I believe that practice makes perfection. After this hard work, I imagined create a simple app with exercises and tips to improve the writing skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://writingskills.leonardofaria.net">Writing for IELTS and TOEFL&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> has 100 exercises to practice writing. In addition, I collected several tips to improve writing skills, such as an effective checklist and an extensive explanation about linking words. All these tips are useful in my exam.&lt;/p>
