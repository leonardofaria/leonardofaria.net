This is one of most popular tests to prove English skills. It is considered by many people a tough exam because it requires not only English skills, but also time management skills.
The test takes 4 hours to be finished. The last part of the test is to write 2 texts in 50 minutes. In the first task, the student is supposed to summarise a text and a lecture, which lecture sometimes cast doubt in the passage.</description></item></channel></rss>
