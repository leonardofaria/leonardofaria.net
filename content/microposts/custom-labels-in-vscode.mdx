When <A href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">App Router</A> was released in Next.js I was not a big fan of the file structure. I thought that having multiple `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` files make things a bit confusing in the code editor.

In [March 2024's release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_88#_custom-labels-for-open-editors), VS Code included a feature that helps labeling the files currently opened in the editor. Here is my customization:

![VS Code tabs](/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/vscode-tabs.jpg)

```json
"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns": {
  "**/app/**/page.{tsx,ts,jsx,js,mdx}": "${dirname} [page]",
  "**/app/**/index.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname} [index]",
  "**/app/**/layout.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname} [layout]",
  "**/app/**/template.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname} [template]",
  // For a second level route
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/page.{tsx,ts,jsx,js,mdx}": "${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [page]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/index.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [index]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/layout.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [layout]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/template.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [template]",
  // For a third level route
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/**/[[]*[]]/page.{tsx,ts,jsx,js,mdx}": "${dirname(2)}/${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [page]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/**/[[]*[]]/index.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(2)}/${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [index]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/**/[[]*[]]/layout.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(2)}/${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [layout]",
  "**/app/**/[[]*[]]/**/[[]*[]]/template.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname(2)}/${dirname(1)}/${dirname} [template]",
  "**/app/**/route.ts": "${dirname} [route]",
  "**/components/**/index.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}": "${dirname} [component]", 
}
```

The configuration takes in consideration routes with nested subroutes, for example `posts/[id]/page.tsx` or `posts/[id]/comments/[commentId]/page.tsx`. I usually wouldn't expect the third level route labeling being needed, but I included in this micropost as an example of extensibility.

The last line of this config improves the navigability of many projects, especially component libraries: people often organize their components into separated folders and use a `index.tsx` for the main code (ex: `button/index.tsx`, `modal/index.tsx`). The change above will improve how these files are shown in the tab bar.
