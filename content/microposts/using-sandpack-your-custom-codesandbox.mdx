For a while I wanted to embed code with previews in a good way in this website. I finally spent a couple of hours adding [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) to it.  

<Playground files={
{
    '/App.tsx': `export default function App() { 
  return (
    <>
      <h1>VANCOUVER</h1>
      <h2>CANADA</h2>
    </>
  );
};`,

    '/styles.css': `
h1 {
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  
  padding: 2%;
}

h2 {
  background: #fff;
  color: #000;
  mix-blend-mode: color-dodge;
  
  padding: 2%;
}

body {
  background: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541369866856-c4f5aa6f5807?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8M3x8dmFuY291dmVyfGVufDB8fDB8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=60') center center no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
  
  font-family: sans-serif;
  height: 100vh;
}
`,
  }
} />

Sandpack is the playground used by [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). It uses different templates (react, react-ts, vue, vanilla, etc) and it supports different themes (I'm a big fan of the GitHub light theme).

I am not going to write a tutorial about adding Sandpack in a React app because [Joshua Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/next-level-playground/) and [Chris Nicholas](https://www.ctnicholas.dev/articles/how-to-use-sandpack-for-code-demos) already did a great job showing how to interact with the components. Their posts were very helpful to add to the good documentation of the project. Despite not writing a tutorial, I can still [show what I did](https://github.com/leonardofaria/leonardofaria.net/tree/master/src/components/playground) if you check this website repository. Or you can read the [Pull Request](https://github.com/leonardofaria/leonardofaria.net/pull/138).

I initially thought in creating something more elaborated with [resizable panels](https://react-resizable-panels.vercel.app) and custom toolbars like Joshua did but I ended up with something smaller.
