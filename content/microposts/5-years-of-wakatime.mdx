[WakaTime](http://wakatime.com) is a plugin you install in your IDE that tracks your code stats. For the last five years I've been using the plugin and here are some fun stats:

WakaTime also offers badges with your total time tracking or project-specific time traking. Here they are:

Does it matter? Nope, but it is fun to see how you spend your time over the years - and please don't make it use CoffeeScript again.
