_“Trauma is perhaps the most avoided, ignored, belittled, denied, misunderstood, and untreated cause of human suffering.”_ - I recently finished reading [The Myth of Normal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58537332-the-myth-of-normal), from also Vancouverite Dr Gabor Maté.

In the book, Dr Maté talks about how trauma is neglected by ourselves and our western medicine and how it impacts our body. It is a reflection about treatments that fix what is hurting today but it doesn't necessarily heal the core issue of the problem. By mentioning different real-life examples - including his own early childhood in Hungary during WWII - and research, the author provokes the reader to self-reflect on their own pain.

It is a long book and there were times that I thought the reading was too negative or too triggering but it is worth reading. It is a relevant book to the world after-2020. If you are intrigued by the book, check out one of his many interviews on YouTube, including this one:
