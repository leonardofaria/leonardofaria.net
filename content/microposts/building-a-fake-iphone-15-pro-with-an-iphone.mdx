True story: a good friend of mine bought an iPhone 13 Pro via Facebook Marketplace. They didn't check the phone, everything seemed legit (including the box) and it turns out it was an [iPhone X converted to look like an iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.fanscreate.com/diy-housing-assembly-rear-back-chassis-housing-for-iphone-x-convert-to-iphone-13-pro-p2346.html). 

The friend returned the phone (the scammer blocked them and we had to find a creative way to meet him) and they got their money back but I was wondered how trick was possible. Now we know.
