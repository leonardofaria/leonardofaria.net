A while ago, I posted about [Emergenetics Explorer](https://leonardofaria.net/2022/04/25/building-emergenetics-explorer) and one small thing I did in that project was adding a map with supercluster (aka geospatial point clustering).

</video>

If you need to do something similar, I got you: a few months ago I decided to extract the code into a [public repository](https://github.com/leonardofaria/google-maps-supercluster-example) and [deploy it](https://google-maps-supercluster-example.vercel.app/) in Vercel.
