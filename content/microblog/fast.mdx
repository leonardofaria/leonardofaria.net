[A good inspiration](https://patrickcollison.com/fast) on ambitious projects:

> - **iPod**. Tony Fadell was hired to create the iPod in late January 2001. Steve Jobs greenlit the project in March 2001. They hired a contract manufacturer in April 2001, announced the product in October 2001, and shipped the first production iPod to customers in November 2001, around 290 days after getting started.

> - **COVID-19 vaccines**. On January 10 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was [published](https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319). 3 days later, Moderna [finalized](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) the sequence for [mRNA-1273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna#COVID-19_vaccine_candidate), its mRNA vaccine candidate; the first batch was manufactured on February 7. On February 24 (45 days after genome publication), Moderna shipped the first batch of mRNA-1273 to the NIH for use in their Phase 1 clinical study. 266 days of clinical trials and regulatory coordination followed. On November 16, Moderna [announced](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy) that the vaccine's efficacy was 94.5%. Source: linked materials. Note: the BioNTech vaccine was produced on a similarly impressive timeline but I haven't yet tracked down sufficiently granular information about its developmentâ€”pointers appreciated.
