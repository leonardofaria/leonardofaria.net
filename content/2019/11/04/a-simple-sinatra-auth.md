Imagine you want to protect the content of a website created with Next.js, Hugo or your favourite static site generator. Github doesn't offer this feature or Netlify offers authentication only in their paid plans. [Decided to create something simple with Sinatra, TailwindCSS and ready to go in Heroku](https://bit.ly/sinatra-auth).
