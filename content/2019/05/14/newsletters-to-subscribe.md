In the last years, newsletters became more and more popular. Along with Twitter and RSS, it is one of my favourite ways to keep me updated it. Here are the ones I follow:

  * [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) – if you are a team lead, engineer manager, CTO you will like this one. Worth to mention their Slack group.
  * [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) – independently of your stack, Changelog is a rich newsletter with interviews and tool suggestions. They also have a podcast – [Example](https://email.changelog.com/t/ViewEmail/t/07B6AC1A841DD8ED2540EF23F30FEDED/D6D7BA67637E86A7F1E87EB810D8F10A)
  * [Dense Directory](https://www.densediscovery.com/) – Every Tuesday a newsletter helping web workers be productive, stay inspired and think critically
  * [dev tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/) – Chrome Dev Tools gifs weekly in your email.
  * [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/) – a once–weekly email roundup of JavaScript news and articles
  * [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/) – another one about JavaScript but React focused – [Example](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/136)
  * [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) – once-weekly emails about Ruby. This one and the previous two are curated by [cooperpress](https://cooperpress.com/)
  * [Daily Developer Tips](https://gomakethings.com/articles/) – code snippets, tools, techniques, and interesting stuff from around the web.
  * [Gartner L2 Daily Insights](https://www.l2inc.com/daily-insights) – news and research analysis across digital marketing, site & e-commerce, mobile and social media.
