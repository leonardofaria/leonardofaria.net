I've in my development mac different virtualhosts, using .local or .wp TLDs. Opening these address in Chrome are slow â€“ about 3 seconds &#8216;resolving address'. This situation doesn't happen in Safari or Firefox. Here is my typical `/etc/hosts` configuration:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost
::1 localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
fe80::1%lo0 localhost

127.0.0.1 website1.local
127.0.0.1 website2.wp
```

Looking for [answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10064581/how-can-i-eliminate-slow-resolving-loading-of-localhost-virtualhost-a-2-3-secon), I changed my setup for:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost website1.local website2.wp
::1 localhost website1.local website2.wp
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
fe80::1%lo0 localhost
```

It works like a charm.
