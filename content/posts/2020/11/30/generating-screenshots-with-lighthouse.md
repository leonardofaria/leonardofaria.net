Lighthouse captures the rendering timeline of a page in 10 images. Do you need to store them? If yes, keep reading in order to learn how to store these images.

The filmstrip above reveals how a page is rendered in a browser and gives us an opportunity to understand what is slow. For example, blank screenshots in the beginning is a sign that the [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/fcp/) is too slow.

In this post you will learn where these images are stored and how to store them in a file system. Here is the script (from my [lighthouse-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/leonardofaria/lighthouse-examples)): 

```js showLineNumbers
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const lighthouse = require('lighthouse');
const chromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');

(async () => {
  const chrome = await chromeLauncher.launch({chromeFlags: ['--headless']});
  const options = {port: chrome.port};
  const { lhr: { audits } } = await lighthouse('https://leonardofaria.net', options);

  audits['screenshot-thumbnails'].details.items
    .forEach(({ timing, data }) => {
      debugger;
      const screenshot = data.split(';base64,').pop();
      const screenshotFile = `screenshot-${timing}ms.jpg`;
      writeFileSync(screenshotFile, screenshot, { encoding: 'base64' });
    });

  const finalScreenshotFile = `screenshot-final.jpg`;
  const finalScreenshot = audits['final-screenshot'].details.data.split(';base64,').pop();
  writeFileSync(finalScreenshotFile, finalScreenshot, { encoding: 'base64' });

  await chrome.kill();
})();
```

Letâ€™s dig into the magic. Starting in line 10, we loop in the screenshot-thumbnails audit the images captured by Lighthouse. Notice that images are encoded in the [Base64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), and along with their content, Lighthouse also stores when they happen. 

The script will create 11 image files as shown below.

### Desktop dimensions

By default, the device emulated in Lighthouse is a Moto G4, with a 5.5 inches screen (1920 x 1080). We can tweak that and emulate a Desktop by setting the `emulatedFormFactor` to `desktop`. The options variable will look like this: 

```js
const options = {port: chrome.port, emulatedFormFactor: 'desktop'};
```

## Why do we need this? 

This script is useful in order to closely follow what is being rendered on a page or web app. In my particular case, I am storing only the final screenshot for future reference (ex. is this the right page?).

Can you think of different uses? Let me know in the comments!
