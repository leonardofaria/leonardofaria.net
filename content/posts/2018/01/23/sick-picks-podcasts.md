I am huge fan of podcasts. It is always nice to hear people's thoughts, struggles, jokes and sick picks. Here is my short list of development-related podcasts.

  * **[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)**: Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski talk about webdevelopment. You can expect lots of Javascript – especially React – and CSS here.
  * **[Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea)**: plenty of episodes about the developer career. Off the top of my head I would recommend the episode about [Experienced Developers and Impostor Syndrome](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/32884).
  * **[Front End Happy Hour](http://frontendhappyhour.com/)**: each episode the hosts toast when someone says a specific word. If you are into style guides, you must head [their episode about it](http://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/top-shelf-style-guides/).
  * **[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/)**: I didn't hear a lot of episodes here but it caught my <s>eyes</s> ears [the one with David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.se-radio.net/2016/06/se-radio-episode-261-david-heinemeier-hansson-on-the-state-of-rails-monoliths-and-more/), creator of Ruby on Rails.
  * **[Vancouver Tech Podcast](http://www.vancouvertechpodcast.ca/)**: last but not least, I've been living in Vancouver for more than 2 years and it's nice to hear the local tech scene.
