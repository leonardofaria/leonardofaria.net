Valentine's Day is right around the corner, so I built [Love Trivia](https://www.lovetrivia.online), a dead-simple web app to create personalized trivia quizzes for your loved one. Instead of generic cards or chocolates, surprise them with "How well do you know me?" quizzes packed with your inside jokes, first-date details, and cute quirks. Don't want to create your own trivia? Choose from pre-made Valentine's trivia for zero-effort fun.

This whole thing actually started because I was thinking about making a trivia app for my birthday party, using websockets so multiple people could play together. But since Valentine’s Day is just a day before my birthday, I decided to shift focus and build something that could be shared more easily and appeal to more people.

Claude did most of the heavy lifting, with a bit of help from Codex. The logo came from Canva, with some editing in [Recraft](https://www.recraft.ai/). I also used Openclaw to organize the questions and answers. Even with all those tools, I still spent time on the design and animations to make it feel nice.
