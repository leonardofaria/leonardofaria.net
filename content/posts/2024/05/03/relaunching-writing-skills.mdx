Back in 2015, I moved to Canada to attend a post-degree program. Foreign students need to take a test to prove their proficiency and IELTS and TOEFL the most popular ones. After taking both tests, I decided to build a [mobile app](https://leonardofaria.net/2015/06/10/writing-skills-for-ielts-and-toefl) with writing prompts, so people like me could practice for the real test.

The app made me a small amount of money and I didn't focus on it since I was busy with a full-time job while restarting my life in Canada. In the last few weeks, I decided to rebuild the application, but this time focusing on the web.

## Features

The original mobile app had 100 writing prompts and some information about the tests and tips on how to structure the texts. I ported this content to the new version and I also want to explore new things, perhaps AI reviews (with [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), for example).

## Stack

Nothing new here, classic TNT ðŸ§¨: TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I am also using Supabase for authentication and database and Stripe for subscriptions. The app has some nice animations with Framer Motion and this is my first time using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

My proof of concept using Replicate was very positive, their wrapper around open-source models make very easy to build something quickly and scalable (as long you also have a good credit card).
