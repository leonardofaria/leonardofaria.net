2 years ago I wrote a [post](https://leonardofaria.net/2015/09/17/useful-apps-that-i-use-daily/) about my tooling and here I am again, 2017 edition. I decided to write again because I keep listening to podcasts with Sick Picks and I also have my Sick Picks :)

## Dev tools

### Editor: Atom

I have been using Atom for a while. Despite I started testing VS Code in the latest months, I returned to Atom because VS Code doesn't separate <A href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25986">UI theme from syntax theme</A> – you may not care about this, but I am a fan of a light UI and a dark code highlight.

[![My Atom](/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screenshot-atom.png)](https://gist.github.com/leonardofaria/982b8055af2d6d02116b03950bbf0583)

Here are the packages that I have installed:  
<span className="hidden">more</span>

* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify): Beautify HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Coldfusion, SQL, and more in Atom
* [atom-ternjs](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ternjs): JavaScript code intelligence for atom with Tern. Adds support for ES5, ES6 (JavaScript 2015), Node.js, jQuery & Angular. Extendable via plugins. Uses suggestion provider by autocomplete-plus.
* [auto-update-packages](https://atom.io/packages/auto-update-packages): Keep your Atom packages up to date.

Just hold &#8216;alt' while you select, or select using your middle mouse button. Also similar to Texmate's &#8216;Multiple Carets', or BBEdit's &#8216;Block Select'
* [sync-settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings): Synchronize package settings, keymap and installed packages

Note: I didn't add in the list linters and language support because it depends basically on the devs choice. Also, since I use sync-settings, you can check <A href="https://gist.github.com/leonardofaria/982b8055af2d6d02116b03950bbf0583">my editor settings on Gist</A>.

### Terminal: iTerm2 + oh-my-zsh

I am using **[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)** for a long time with Zsh and **<A href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</A>**. If you are not familiar with these tools, I strongly suggest watching Wes Bos **[Command Line Power User](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/)** free videos.

### Github: Gitify

**[Gitify](http://www.gitify.io)** is an app on the menubar that brings Github notifications. I know, there are email notifications or Chrome extensions but what I like in Gitify: it just works. New notification: icon color change in the menubar.

### Github: Codehub

**[CodeHub](http://codehub-app.com/)** is how I get connected to my GitHub profile out of computer. Again, I am not a fan of a full inbox and it is easy to browse the Pull Request that I am participating. You may need to in-app buy the Pro version to get access to private repositories.

## Database-related tools

**[Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/)** is a beautiful and open-source app to handle MySQL databases. You can save your favourite connections and queries.

If you want to handle Postgres you may need **[PSequel](http://www.psequel.com/)** or **[TablePlus](https://tableplus.io)**. Why two apps? PSequel gets job done but I noticed that I can't edit PostgreSQL JSON types fields, which is handled by TablePlus. I am probably going to switch to only TablePlus soon since the UI is much better.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screenshot-tableplus.png?ss)](https://tableplus.io/)

Last but not least, **[Tad](https://www.tadviewer.com/)** is useful to deal with CSVs.

## Other tools

**[CloudApp](https://my.cl.ly/r/0f0P0e3g1O0x2k18)** is one of many apps to store screenshots and short videos. What made choose it is the ability to set a custom domain for your files, which is quite handy.

**[Franz](https://meetfranz.com)** is useful because it groups all your Slacks, Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram and everything else in one single window.

**<A href="https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket">LaunchRocket</A>** is definitely an app that you need to install if you install services via Homebrew. It searches services in the Homebrew folder and list them inside the System Preferences.

[![launchrocket](/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screenshot-launchrocket.png)](https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket)

**[MenuMeters](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/)** adds in the menubar the CPU usage. [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) is probably the most famous and it deliveries much more stuff but I want to keep this simple.

**[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com)** is an <A href="https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle">open source</A> window control app via shortcuts. Since I use a 4K display is quite handy having all windows in place.

**[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)** is my favourite Git GUI because it is friendly and free. It helps me a lot interacting with my repositories.
