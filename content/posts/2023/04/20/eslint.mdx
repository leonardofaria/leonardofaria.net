Have you ever asked yourself how ESLint works and what we can do with it? In this post, I guarantee that you will learn one thing or two about this linter and its rules.

## Intro

A linter is a tool that statically analyzes your code and based on their rules, reports warnings and errors. Linters are helpful to catch bugs and enforce standards in a codebase.

ESLint is the most popular JavaScript linter these days but it is not the only one: [JSHint](https://jshint.com) was a popular tool in the past and [Rome](https://rome.tools) is a promising tool that accomplishes similar goals.

### But, how exactly?

We can not talk about linters without talking about AST (Abstract Syntax Trees). AST is a JavaScript object containing a tree representation of your code. Let's use as example a function that sums two numbers:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, 2);
```

The AST for the code above will be a three like:

```json
{
  "type": "Program",
  "start": 0,
  "end": 50,
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "FunctionDeclaration",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 38,
      "id": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "start": 9,
        "end": 12,
        "name": "sum"
      },
      "expression": false,
      "generator": false,
      "async": false,
      "params": [
        {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "start": 13,
          "end": 14,
          "name": "a"
        },
        {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "start": 16,
          "end": 17,
          "name": "b"
        }
      ],
      "body": {
        "type": "BlockStatement",
        "start": 19,
        "end": 38,
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "ReturnStatement",
            "start": 23,
            "end": 36,
            "argument": {
              "type": "BinaryExpression",
              "start": 30,
              "end": 35,
              "left": {
                "type": "Identifier",
                "start": 30,
                "end": 31,
                "name": "a"
              },
              "operator": "+",
              "right": {
                "type": "Identifier",
                "start": 34,
                "end": 35,
                "name": "b"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "start": 40,
      "end": 50,
      "expression": {
        "type": "CallExpression",
        "start": 40,
        "end": 49,
        "callee": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "start": 40,
          "end": 43,
          "name": "sum"
        },
        "arguments": [
          {
            "type": "Literal",
            "start": 44,
            "end": 45,
            "value": 1,
            "raw": "1"
          },
          {
            "type": "Literal",
            "start": 47,
            "end": 48,
            "value": 2,
            "raw": "2"
          }
        ],
        "optional": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "sourceType": "module"
}
```

The parser is smart enough to ignore spaces and things that don't matter: `console.log('Hello')` and `console.log(    'Hello'    )` are the same. A linter will analyze the object and report warnings and errors according to its rules. For example, a linter can scan this code and report that we should not have a function called `sum`.

You can use a website like [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net) to create a object of your code or [jointJS JavaScript AST Visualiser](https://www.jointjs.com/demos/abstract-syntax-tree) to create the chart above.

(talk about linter, no console)

## Commands

(run for a specific file, folder, override)

## Rules and plugins

(talk about a simple rule like no-console)

## Curious rules

(things like import order)
