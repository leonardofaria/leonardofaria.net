![codestacker](/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/codestacker.jpg)

Some years ago, precisely on [July/2008](https://leonardofaria.net/2008/07/02/nasceu-codestackercom/) I created [codestacker](http://codestacker.com). I know, there were several options to collect snippets, but I decided to code my own solution. More than that I have planned to develop a Textmate bundle and a Mac OS Widget (who cares?), however I did not code these functions.

In the latest days, I migrated all old data to a new app written in Rails 4.2 and hosted on Heroku. The <A href="https://github.com/leonardofaria/codestacker">source code is available</A> in Github.
