I decided write a post describing some tools that I use in my MacBook to enhance my tasks.

### Alfred

How awesome is Alfred? It is totally awesome! Alfred is a great tool working as a shortcut to daily tasks. More than that, you can create customized workflows that improve even more your productivity. You must see:

* [Yet another layouter](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3154-yet-another-window-layout-workflow/): you can use keyworks like top left, top right to resize and move windows. This is really useful for people who use multiple displays
* [Battery](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1211-battery-view-summary-stats-about-your-laptop-battery/): it is a workflow that shows relevant information about battery, such as charge cycles, health and serial number
* [Alfred Workflows Forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/3-share-your-workflows/): the community forum where people share their workflows
* [Packal](http://www.packal.org/): an unofficial directory of workflows and themes. My currently theme is the [Elegant v4](http://www.packal.org/theme/elegant-v4), but you can choose your favorite in [several options](http://www.packal.org/theme-list?items_per_page=60).

### Watts

[Watts](http://binarytricks.com/) is a calibration tool to keep laptop battery healthy. It shows notifications suggesting you calibrate your battery.

### Vienna

[**Vienna**](http://www.vienna-rss.org/) is a RSS Reader. It is a minimalist client that runs like a menubar app. I use it because I have few intranet feeds that do not work in Feedly.

### coconutBattery

[coconutBattery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) shows a lot of information about laptop and iDevices battery, such as charge cycles and maximum charge. You can store these information to monitor the battery's health.

### Itsycal

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/itsycal2.jpg" alt="Itsycal" align="right" />](http://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/)[Itsycal](http://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) is useful to avoid opening Calendar every time that I need to check an appointment. It is actually a free alternative to Fantastical.

### Moom

[Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) is a window layouter app. You can use keyboard shortcuts to resize and move windows. I removed this app after I started using an Alfred workflow described in this post.

### Time Tracker

[Time Tracker](http://rainer.4950.net/timetracker-for-mac/) is an old free software that just works. You can record time from different projects and tasks. I can say that this app is one of the freelancer's best friend.

### WhatApp Desktop

There are dozens of WhatsApp Web apps, but I've been using [this option](https://github.com/Aluxian/WhatsApp-Desktop), which runs in background as a menubar app. The same developer also created a [Facebook Messenger for Desktop](http://messengerfordesktop.com/).
