[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11374268_545132382310394_526835071_n-300x300.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="300" />](https://instagram.com/p/7YvAhwDTUUtj6ek4NwiLqLnnxcvmSu8lnkHhE0/?taken-by=leonardofaria) I have just moved this week to Vancouver. I started my [Web and Mobile App Design and Development post-degree](http://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html) in Langara. 

Maybe I should write a blog talking about cultural differences between Brazil and Canada, like dozens of Brazilians but I think that those pages show limited or inaccurate point of views.

New times are coming! :)
