[the ink magazine](http://bit.ly/the-ink-magazine) was an [assignment](http://wrmf.ca/posts/wmdd-4815-assignments/) of my [HTML & CSS classes](http://wrmf.ca/posts/wmadd-4815-outline/) in the [Web and Mobile App Design and Development](http://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html) program, performed in [Langara College](http://langara.bc.ca).

The students was supposed to create a magazine responsive layout using HTML/CSS. (I usually use Gulp and SASS in my projects, however, I didn't use extra tools in this task).

The [source code](http://bit.ly/1M9LNF5) is available in [my Github profile](http://github.com/leonardofaria/).
