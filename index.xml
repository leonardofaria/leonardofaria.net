The network tab will give you a table containing all assets loaded on the page, as well as relevant information about their origin (domain, HTTP status code, size), who initiated the request, and the order in which they were loaded in a waterfall representation.</description></item><item><title>The Mentoring Framework</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/06/01/the-mentoring-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/06/01/the-mentoring-framework/</guid><description>Last October I created a Mentoring Framework at work. The goal was creating a project from scratch using Ruby on Rails and in this journey, learning more about Ruby, Frontend, Project Management and Git, Databases and DevOps.
This Mentoring Framework is similar to what bootcamps do but the difference here is I am sharing a list of suggested features / things to learn and the person can focus in what is important for them.</description></item><item><title>Changing node versions automatically per directory</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/05/20/changing-node-versions-automatically-per-directory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/05/20/changing-node-versions-automatically-per-directory/</guid><description>Working in multiple Node projects sometimes means using different versions of Node. nvm is one popular solution for Linux, macOS and Windows WSL that handles multiple Node installations. One of its most unknown tricks is the deeper shell integration. Check the video:
If you are using macOS Catalina, you are probably using ZSH as default shell. To make the magic happen, paste the following in ~/.zshrc file.

Versioning: sometimes dependencies can require specific versions of other dependencies and this can cause hiccups in your app; Bundling: you need to be careful here to not bring extra code that will bloat your bundles; Updating: JavaScript moves fast and if you don&amp;rsquo;t update packages regularly, you&amp;rsquo;ll play Jenga in the future.</description></item><item><title>Facing impostor syndrome and time management issues</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/04/26/facing-impostor-syndrome-and-time-management-issues/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 11:41:56 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/04/26/facing-impostor-syndrome-and-time-management-issues/</guid><description>I often hear people talking about impostor syndrome and time management issues. Sometimes I hear about these issues from a friend, a direct report, and occasionally from myself. We are always challenged by them and they can affect our mood, our ability to be productive and our judgement.
We have days where everything works great and also we have bad days, where everything seems to go wrong. This emotional roller coaster can make us doubt our accomplishments and can create a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud.</description></item><item><title>Moving to Hugo</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/04/21/moving-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:41:56 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2020/04/21/moving-to-hugo/</guid><description>In the last few days, I worked to move this website to Hugo.

&lt;p>A while ago I started an Apple Collection. After a few laptops and a few iDevices, I decided that I should start collecting info about my iThings. In the beginning, I created a gist containing model, serial number, how did I get the device, minimum/maximum OS, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The list kept going bigger and bigger and the content started looking messy. The natural way to organize my data would be inside a SQL database, with the information distributed in columns. After organizing the information in tables, I would create a graphQL API (the one cool kids use these days) to give me the data needed to populate my UI – probably written in React, compiled with Babel and packed with webpack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forcing the usage of yarn (and at a specific version)</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2019/10/11/forcing-the-usage-of-yarn-and-at-a-specific-version/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:40:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2019/10/11/forcing-the-usage-of-yarn-and-at-a-specific-version/</guid><description>&lt;p>People and organizations often have preferences for a specific package manager.

Creating new accounts or shopping in an online store are examples of this feature saving us time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the autofill feature can be a problem for SaaS products. Imagine that you want to edit the email address of one of your users. You hit edit in one screen and once you get a form with your user data Chrome will replace their email to your email. This is not a good user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MDN has an article showing “How to turn off form autocompletion”. The solution is using the autocomplete attribute with an off value. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in Chrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging in Stackoverflow and Google results, I found a &lt;a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153#c164">bug issued in 2015 about the topic&lt;/a>.

The following document is my People Lead Readme (sometimes known as Manager Readme), where I talk about me and I share my expectations on people and on the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what">What?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This document is an extended introduction to what I value and believe in as a team leader and software developer. It is also a quick introduction about myself and how I work.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This document doesn&amp;rsquo;t replace getting to know each other through 1:1s and day-to-day chats. As I said before, it is an introduction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This document applies only to me, and in no way should be considered to apply to any other team lead or manager at Thinkific – even though we think in similar ways sometimes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you feel like I am not acting like I describe here, please let me know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are curious why this document exists in the first place: there is a newsletter called &lt;a href="http://softwareleadweekly.com/">SoftwareLeadWeekly&lt;/a> (recommended) and managers &lt;a href="http://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/271">share their own readme&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> there.

One of the challenges of using React is creating reusable components not only from a look and feel perspective but also shareable in different projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t create this concept of elements (or components) library. To be honest, there are podcasts, courses, and examples everywhere about it but how to even start it? When you start creating a project from scratch you face several questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How to style components? Sass? Stylus? styled-components?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to show the elements?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to build the library? Babel? Webpack?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to publish the library? To NPM or not NPM?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to use integrations and CI in your favour?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Lots of decisions and you may not know all the answers. Startup Life™ doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you do whatever you want – everything has a cost and a trade-off. Why am I talking all this story?

RawGit is a solution to serve files with the correct content types.
Example: The WordPress readme.html file can be shown in the following URL:
https://rawgit.com/WordPress/WordPress/master/readme.html You only need to follow the formula:
https://rawgit.com/USER/REPOSITORY/BRANCH/file.html The advantage of using RawGit over Github Pages is that RawGit works with all branches, while Github Pages requires a gh-pages branch.</description></item><item><title>Todo list using a Sinatra REST API</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2016/07/26/todo-list-using-sinatra-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2016 19:01:16 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2016/07/26/todo-list-using-sinatra-rest-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am attending to a &lt;a href="http://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html">post-degree program&lt;/a> and one of its courses is Server-Side Scripting.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>binary_file_patterns&lt;/code>: This option excludes files from the index but keep them in the sidebar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>folder_exclude_patterns&lt;/code>: This option excludes files from the index and sidebar. This is why, for example, you don&amp;rsquo;t see the &lt;code>.git&lt;/code> folder in a project.&lt;/li>

Com isso, resolvi escrever uma receitinha de como fazer isso.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inicialmente você deve criar um arquivo mapeando seus usuários do SVN para o GIT. Ele deverá ter o formato abaixo:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>leonardo = Leonardo Faria &amp;lt;leonardo@email.com&amp;gt;
autor2 = Autor &amp;lt;autor@email.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Nota: caso você não queira manualmente escrever esse arquivo, vasculhe o log do seu projeto SVN e obtenha a lista de autores automaticamente:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">svn log -q | awk -F &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;|&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;/^r/ {sub(&amp;#34;^ &amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;, $2); sub(&amp;#34; $&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;, $2); print $2&amp;#34; = &amp;#34;$2&amp;#34; &amp;lt;&amp;#34;$2&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span> | sort -u &amp;gt; authors.txt

Na monografia fiz uma introdução sobre as características do framework, reproduzido abaixo:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>O framework Ruby on Rails foi extraído de um sistema para gerenciamento de projetos chamado Basecamp. A primeira versão do framework foi oficialmente lançada em 25 de Julho de 2004 e seu desenvolvimento conta com colaboradores em todo o mundo liderados pelo programador dinamarquês David Heinemeier Hansson.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mvc">MVC&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Um padrão de projeto descreve e provê uma solução para um problema freqüente, sendo genérico e reusável. São criados a partir de problemas de problemas comuns enfrentados no desenvolvimento de projetos de software.&lt;br>
A criação de componentes reutilizáveis é uma das técnicas mais exploradas em Engenharia de Software. O uso de componentes diminui o tempo de desenvolvimento e a taxa de erros de codificação. Um padrão pode ser entendido como a abstração de detalhes sobre a implementação de um software.&lt;/p>

Minha monografia e meu trabalho de conclusão de curso da Faculdade foram sobre o &lt;a href="http://www.autosimulado.com.br">&lt;strong>autosimulado&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Na monografia fiz uma introdução sobre as características da linguagem Ruby, reproduzido abaixo:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ruby">Ruby&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A linguagem Ruby foi criada em 1993 pelo japonês Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, com sua primeira versão pública lançada em 1995. Para Matz, o primeiro desejo é de Ruby tornar os programadores felizes, reduzindo o trabalho manual que precisasse ser feito. Segundo ele, o desenvolvimento de sistemas deveria enfatizar as necessidades do homem e não da máquina:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Muitas pessoas, especialmente engenheiros de computação, focam nas máquinas. Eles pensam, “Fazendo isso, a máquina será mais rápida. Fazendo isso, a máquina será mais eficiente. Fazendo isso, a máquina irá fazer determinada coisa melhor”. Eles estão focando nas máquinas. Mas de fato nós precisamos focar nos humanos, em como os humanos lidam com programação ou operação das aplicações das máquinas. Nós somos os mestres. Elas são as escravas. (VENNERS, 2003).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ruby é uma linguagem orientada a objetos, ou seja, qualquer variável é um objeto, mesmo classes e tipos que em muitas linguagens são designadas como primitivos. Por exemplo:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">putz &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;meu exemplo&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>upcase &lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># imprimirá MEU EXEMPLO&lt;/span>

Muitas dessas pessoas possuem aplicativos web, outras desenvolvem no tempo livre por prazer (como eu), outras trabalham offshore.</description></item><item><title>Rails Summit: resumo do segundo dia</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/10/14/rails-summit-resumo-do-segundo-dia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2009 13:07:05 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/10/14/rails-summit-resumo-do-segundo-dia/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="richard-kilmerhttptwittercomrich_kilmer-macruby">&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rich_kilmer">Richard Kilmer&lt;/a>: MacRuby&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A primeira palestra do segundo dia trouxe o americano Richard Kilmer que falou sobre &lt;a href="http://www.macruby.org">MacRuby&lt;/a>, a união entre Ruby e Objective-C. Notas dos slides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Problems with RubyCocoa: It&amp;rsquo;s a bridge; 2 runtimes, 2 GC, different syntax&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MacRuby 0.4: Objective-C 2 + Ruby 1.9&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every Ruby class is an Objective-C class&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every Ruby object is an Objective-C object&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every Ruby method is an Objective-C method&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MacRuby é um pouco mais rápido do que Objective-C&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MacRuby utiliza recursos de processamento paralelo do OS X&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HotCocoa is an idiomatic Ruby API that simplifies the configuration and wiring together of Objetive-C/Cocoa classes – resumindo: simplifica a sintaxe e deixa algo mais ‘Ruby Way&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>O Nando falou do que há de novo no Ruby 1.9, tema inclusive de um &lt;a href="http://howtocode.com.br/o-que-mudou-no-ruby-19">PDF&lt;/a> de sua série &lt;a href="http://howtocode.com.br/">HOWTO&lt;/a>. Sua apresentação, bem bonita, trouxe inúmeras notas sobre as mudanças da linguagem.

&lt;li>Stop doing things you know are wrong!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A primeira Rubyconf aconteceu em 2001 com 34 pessoas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nenhum dos participantes ganhava $ com Ruby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 dos 34 participantes escreveram o Agile Manifesto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The survival rate for startups is way less than 50%. So if you&amp;rsquo;re running a startup, you had betted be doing something old. If not, you&amp;rsquo;re in Trouble”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implante uma nova tecnologia gradativamente.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t do (.Net | Java | C++ | C | Perl l PHP) in Ruby: a razão de trocar de tecnologia é fazer as coisas diferentes!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Linguagens de computador são como namoradas: a nova é melhor porque você é melhor.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Gregg Pollack, o cara dos screencasts do &lt;a href="http://www.RailsEnvy.com/">RailsEnvy&lt;/a>, falou sobre performance. Primeiramente ele trouxe em 60 segundos algumas coisinhas para otimizar apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Usar Yslow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cache: Page Caching, Action Caching, Fragment Caching, Object Caching&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid Cache expiration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use memcached&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use background process&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Client-side caching: etags &amp;amp; last-modified&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t pre-optimize: 99% of the time you&amp;rsquo;ll need 0%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t abuse your database&lt;/li>

Sim, a Apple é quase perfeita, erros de projeto acontecem e muita gente por aí também tinha Mac trincado. Não é falta de cuidado, carrego a máquina em uma luva da Case Logic de Neoprene e o que se percebe é que o problema está nas travas de fechar do display. Começou com um cantinho quebrado e até semana passada ele já estava trincado em quatro lugares.</description></item><item><title>Alternativas ao PHPMyAdmin</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/22/alternativas-ao-phpmyadmin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2009 16:32:36 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/22/alternativas-ao-phpmyadmin/</guid><description>O PHPMyAdmin é quase uma unanimidade em gerenciadores de banco de dados MySQL. Mas existe vida além dele. Vamos lá:
SQL Buddy O SQL Buddy é uma alternativa bacana, com bonita interface e traduzido para vários idiomas, incluindo português.
Adminer Já o Adminer é um app em php feito em 1(!) único arquivo. Possui diversas traduções (nenhuma ainda em português) mas é altamente indicado o mantermos em nossos servidores para uma rápida manutenção.</description></item><item><title>Todo lists para o Textmate</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/22/todo-lists-para-o-textmate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2009 16:06:36 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/22/todo-lists-para-o-textmate/</guid><description>Fica a dica para quem usa o Textmate: Tasks é um bundle para o Textmate que permite a criação de Todo lists bonitinhas.
A instalação é fácil:
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles git clone git://github.com/henrik/tasks.tmbundle.git Tasks.tmbundle osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles' Depois disso, todos os arquivos .todo, .todolist e .tasks serão formatados de acordo com o bundle.</description></item><item><title>Paperclip validando imagens no IE</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/16/paperclip-validando-imagens-no-ie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2009 21:47:57 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/08/16/paperclip-validando-imagens-no-ie/</guid><description>No autosimulado, tive um problema onde o IE (sempre ele) não validava o mime-type de uma imagem.

Periodicamente, vejo o número de usuários criados dia-a-dia no site e o número de testes realizados por esses usuários.
Relacionado as essas queries, vi uma interessante consulta para agrupar o número de usuários por domínio de email, através da função substring. Confira:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total, SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, &amp;#39;@&amp;#39;, -1) AS Domain FROM users GROUP BY SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, &amp;#39;@&amp;#39;, -1) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10; O resultado, quando aplicado ao banco de dados do autosimulado:</description></item><item><title>Curiosidade Ruby do dia #2</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/07/01/curiosidade-ruby-do-dia-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 21:03:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/07/01/curiosidade-ruby-do-dia-2/</guid><description>Em outra curiosidade Ruby do dia, eu falei do elsif.

P.S.: o método chama-se succ e não suck.

A dica de hoje é copiar o ‘dicionário&amp;rsquo; do jQuery para a pasta de dicionários do seu usuário (~/Library/Dictionaries) e curtir a documentação do jQuery dentro do Spotlight.
PS.: existe também um aplicativo AIR com a API do jQuery.

A inspiração para o autosimulado apareceu quando minha namorada foi tirar carteira, e ao tentar ajudá-la procurando provas, só encontrei coisas chatas, feias e sem usabilidade.

O browser gerou um mimimi profundo por todo lado e não é por pouco: implementou algumas coisinhas vindas do Chrome, mas tudo de forma bem sofisticada, como tudo que vem de Cupertino.
O Safari traz o “Top Sites”, como no Chrome, e incorpora o Coverflow para favoritos e itens do histórico.</description></item><item><title>Documentação do Rails e Ruby no Spotlight</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/02/08/documentacao-do-rails-e-ruby-no-spotlight/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2009 23:12:35 -0200</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/02/08/documentacao-do-rails-e-ruby-no-spotlight/</guid><description>Essa é uma dica bem interessante: um cara chamado Priit Haamer migrou as documentações do Rails e do Ruby para o dicionário do Mac OS.

O que esperar de uma biografia de alguém que revolucionou a computação moderna, o cinema de animação, o mercado de música e a telefonia? Acabo de ler “A Cabeça de Steve Jobs”, de Leander Kahney e essa obra pode representar muito para nossas vidas, principalmente se você ter as ações e mantras de Jobs como inspiração para seus trabalhos.</description></item><item><title>Para turbinar o Safari</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/01/25/para-turbinar-o-safari/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2009 21:28:26 -0200</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2009/01/25/para-turbinar-o-safari/</guid><description>Muitos que migram para o Mac continuam usando o Firefox, graças as suas extensões maravilhosas.

A vantagem de um equipamento recondicionado é o preço: existem produtos com descontos expressivos, chegando até a 40%. Além disso, muitos consideram que um produto recondicionado seria até mais confiável que um produto não-recondicionado, já que equipamentos refurbished passariam duas vezes por testes durante sua produção.</description></item><item><title>Curiosidade Ruby do dia</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2007/06/28/curiosidade-ruby-do-dia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2007 18:27:44 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2007/06/28/curiosidade-ruby-do-dia/</guid><description>Não existe ‘else if&amp;rsquo; em Ruby e sim ‘elsif&amp;rsquo; – sem o ‘e&amp;rsquo; mesmo!

Atualmente, tenho usado o Spotmilk, um tema muito bem feito. Já testei também o Tiger, um tema que lembra a interface daquele sistema operacional da turma de Cupertino. Só um detalhezinho: o Tiger não é compatível com o IE.
A instalação desses temas é bem simples, bastando somente enviar os arquivos de layout para a pasta wp-plugins.</description></item><item><title>Por que o Linux não decola?</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2006/08/20/por-que-o-linux-nao-decola/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2006 15:20:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2006/08/20/por-que-o-linux-nao-decola/</guid><description>O Bruno acha que instalar programas no Linux é mais fácil que no Windows.

Conheço Linux já a um bom tempo. Primeira distribuição que vi na minha vida devia ser daqueles Conectivas Guaranis, por volta de 1999. A primeira distro que instalei, num velho K6 que eu tinha, foi o Conectiva 6.

O rótulo “Web2.0” surgiu em 2005, pelas mãos do Tim O&amp;rsquo;Reilly. A grosso modo, significa reforçar o conceito social da Internet, que seria de troca de informações e colaboração dos usuários, nos mais diversos serviços. É a exaltação da simplicidade e a glorificação do conteúdo.</description></item><item><title>Migração para Macintosh</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2006/07/01/migracao-para-macintosh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2006 15:04:17 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2006/07/01/migracao-para-macintosh/</guid><description>Momento Caparica: Muitos que estão habituados a PCs e se migram para o Mac OS apresentam diversas dúvidas.

Observando as últimas notícias:
Opera 8 lançado com suporte à voz, Gmail e uma série de features que acabam virando extensions no Firefox; Mozilla Firefox alcançando 50 milhões de downloads e chegando à quase 9% de participação no mercado; Safari passando pelo Acid 2. O Acid 2 é um teste proposto pelo The Web Standards Project para observar como os browsers renderizam a formatação.</description></item><item><title>Ajax</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/19/ajax/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2005 21:27:12 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/19/ajax/</guid><description>Ajax é mais uma das palavras da moda (assim como tableless).
Para quem não sabe, é um label para um trabalho envolvendo:
Apresentação webstandard (XHTML e CSS); Interação e exibição dinâmica com DOM; Interação e manipulação de dados com XML; Interatividade de dados usando XMLHTTPRequest; Javascript resolvido os outros problemas. Mais do mesmo: Artigo esclarecedor de ‘conceituação&amp;rsquo; do Ajax Links com exemplos e artigos. Em um desses links, encontrei um batepapo que utiliza da abordagem.</description></item><item><title>Adobe compra Macromedia</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/18/adobe-compra-macromedia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2005 21:21:19 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/18/adobe-compra-macromedia/</guid><description>Mais interessante e assustador do que a compra da Conectiva, pela Mandrake, é a compra da Macromedia feita pela Adobe. A transação, que custou aos bolsos da empresa do Photoshop 3,4 bilhões de dólares promote mudar o mercado.
E agora? Teremos um Adobe Go Dreamweaver Home Site? E que tal um Macromedia Image works? O que se ouve dizer é que o nome Macromedia não deverá ser usado e que a Adobe buscará o melhor dos softwares da ex-concorrente para seus produtos.</description></item><item><title>Flash 8?</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/15/flash-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2005 21:16:30 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/04/15/flash-8/</guid><description>A Macromedia já está preparando a nova versão do software e, inclusive, já vazaram algumas imagens.
Uma das novidades que me chamou a atenção é uma nova guia de propriedades, que permite aplicar diversos efeitos de filtros – aqueles conhecidos da famíla Macromedia.
Vale agora esperar o lançamento.</description></item><item><title>Web Essentials 2004</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/27/web-essentials-2004/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2005 21:14:56 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/27/web-essentials-2004/</guid><description>2 links interessantes sobre o Web Essentials 2004, que aconteceu em Sidney.
Pushing your limits, apresentação sobre CSS, proferida por Douglas Bowman
Vídeos do evento. Tem até o keynote do Zeldman!

Mesmo ainda que vários browsers não suportam sequer a versão 2, o W3C soltou uma lista de features. O que deveremos ter:
Border: cantos arredondados; sombras; bordas complexas feitas de várias imagens ladrilhadas; Comportamento CSS: adição de comportamentos aos estilos, ou seja mudanças dinâmicas ao estilo ou ao documento em resposta a cliques e/ou teclas pressionadas; Layout multi-colunas: novas propriedades para criar layouts de colunas mais flexíveis; Perfil móvel 1.</description></item><item><title>Internet Explorer: porque não contar com ele</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/26/internet-explorer-porque-nao-contar-com-ele/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2005 21:06:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/26/internet-explorer-porque-nao-contar-com-ele/</guid><description>A minha raiva (e a de todos) do Internet Explorer é justificável. Esse navegador web conta com uma série de falhas, que além de inseguras, tornam-o também incompatíveis com os padrões web.
Quando estou criando um site, deixo de utilizar alguns atributos importantes do CSS, como position, min-height, max-height, min-width, max-width, além de não ter um suporte completo a pseudo-seletores (:hover, :after, :before). Isso sem contar com o suporte (digo, falta de suporte) à transparência de imagens PNG e de não poder utilizar formatação de elementos por filtragem de atributos (exemplo: input[button], input[submit]).</description></item><item><title>Homepage – Usabilidade: 50 sites desconstruídos</title><link>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/25/homepage-usabilidade-50-sites-desconstruidos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2005 22:45:50 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://leonardofaria.net/2005/03/25/homepage-usabilidade-50-sites-desconstruidos/</guid><description>Algo importante visto no livro de Jacob Nielsen e Marie Tamir.
